abstract = {Bacteria grow and transform elements at different rates, and as yet, quantifying this variation in the environment is difficult. Determining isotope enrichment with fine taxonomic resolution after exposure to isotope tracers could help, but there are few suitable techniques. We propose a modification to stable isotope probing (SIP) that enables the isotopic composition of DNA from individual bacterial taxa after exposure to isotope tracers to be determined. In our modification, after isopycnic centrifugation, DNA is collected in multiple density fractions, and each fraction is sequenced separately. Taxon-specific density curves are produced for labeled and nonlabeled treatments, from which the shift in density for each individual taxon in response to isotope labeling is calculated. Expressing each taxon's density shift relative to that taxon's density measured without isotope enrichment accounts for the influence of nucleic acid composition on density and isolates the influence of isotope tracer assimilation. The shift in density translates quantitatively to isotopic enrichment. Because this revision to SIP allows quantitative measurements of isotope enrichment, we propose to call it quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP). We demonstrated qSIP using soil incubations, in which soil bacteria exhibited strong taxonomic variations in (18)O and (13)C composition after exposure to [(18)O]water or [(13)C]glucose. The addition of glucose increased the assimilation of (18)O into DNA from [(18)O]water. However, the increase in (18)O assimilation was greater than expected based on utilization of glucose-derived carbon alone, because the addition of glucose indirectly stimulated bacteria to utilize other substrates for growth. This example illustrates the benefit of a quantitative approach to stable isotope probing. Copyright {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Microorganisms in soil assimilate, transform, and mineralize soil C to support growth. There are an estimated 2.6 Â´ 1029 microbial cells containing 26 Pg C in soils world- wide. Consequently, quantifying microbial growth in soil is critical for determining the degree to which microorganisms contribute to the global C cycle. Measuring taxon- specifi c microbial growth enables understanding of the contribution of microbial taxa to elemental transformations across ecosystems and their susceptibility to environ- mental perturbations. These measurements in soil have largely been lacking due to inadequate methods. Quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) with H2 18O is used to measure taxon-specifi c growth of microbial taxa in soil, an improvement com- pared with traditional stable isotope probing (SIP). In qSIP, DNA extracted from both a labeled (18O-enriched water) and an unlabeled treatment is separated into numer- ous density fractions by isopycnic centrifugation, and target genes are quantifi ed and sequenced in each fraction. The taxon-specifi c DNA density shift and ultimately the isotopic composition (18O enrichment) is calculated for each taxon. Here we dis- cuss methods and illustrate the procedure for quantifying microbial taxon-specifi c growth in soil with qSIP using heavy isotope enriched H2 18O.},

abstract = {Understanding how population-level dynamics contribute to ecosystem-level processes is a primary focus of ecological research and has led to important breakthroughs in the ecology of macroscopic organisms. However, the inability to measure population-specific rates, such as growth, for microbial taxa within natural assemblages has limited ecologists' understanding of how microbial populations interact to regulate ecosystem processes. Here, we use isotope incorporation within DNA molecules to model taxon-specific population growth in the presence of 18O-labeled water. By applying this model to phylogenetic marker sequencing data collected from stable-isotope probing studies, we estimate rates of growth, mortality, and turnover for individual microbial populations within soil assemblages. When summed across the entire bacterial community, our taxon-specific estimates are within the range of other whole-assemblage measurements of bacterial turnover. Because it can be applied to environmental samples, the approach we present is broadly applicable to measuring population growth, mortality, and associated biogeochemical process rates of microbial taxa for a wide range of ecosystems and can help reveal how individual microbial populations drive biogeochemical fluxes.},
